## Planned Enhancements

We aim to continuously improve CacheCleaner. Some features planned for future releases include:

- Cleaning for VLC Media Player cache
- Cleaning for Windows Update cache
- Option to flush DNS cache

*Note: We've encountered some technical difficulties with our current toolset for modifying the PowerShell script, which has temporarily delayed the implementation of these features. We're working on resolving these issues.*

## How to Use

Launch CacheCleaner by opening **PowerShell as Administrator** and running the command below:

```powershell
Start-Process powershell -ArgumentList "Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force; Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/makhlwf/cache_cleaner/refs/heads/main/cache_cleaner_by_makhlwf.ps1' -OutFile 'cache_cleaner.ps1'; .\cache_cleaner.ps1" -Verb RunAs
```

This will:

1. Temporarily allow scripts in your session
